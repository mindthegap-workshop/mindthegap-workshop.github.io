# MIND THE GAP WORKSHOP

Welcome to Mind the Gap workshop! In this workshop we will be helping you learn more about the open source development process. 

There will be three main personas that we will be learning more about in this exercise: Team Lead, team developer and external developer. Each role has unique responsiblities and things they need to do to help maintain the health of an open source project. As a team, you will walk through each of these three personas together but one person will be "driving".

## Competition

No workshop is without a little healthy competition! For bragging rights of being _the_ funniest group of people in the UN, we will have an open competition on which team has come up with the best joke! Each team only has one submission they can make. Near the end of the workshop, we will ask all teams to submit their funniest joke to our funniest joke [forum](https://github.com/mindthegap-workshop/mindthegap-workshop.github.io/discussions/2) where you can submit and vote for your funniest jokes!

## Open Source Development Personas

Within every team, you will identify team members to have specific roles:
- Team Lead
    - This person will be in charge of "owning" the repository and learning how to manage it from an administrative perspective
- Team developer
    - This person will be in charge of contributing to the project as a developer who is a part of the UN
- External developer
    - This person will be in charge of contributing to the project as an outside collaborator

Within your team, you will only have one team lead and the rest of you will be split as either a team developer or an external developer. 

Within your breakout rooms, please choose one person to be your "lead" team developer or "lead" external developer. They will be the ones that share their screen and go through the process first while the rest of the team watches and observes and provides help. Once the team developer and external developer have both gone through with the process, all other developers can go through the guide independently or can feel free to share their screen to get help from their teammates.

### Team Lead

As the team lead, you will be responsible for maintaining our open source repository. We will go through a series of steps to help prepare our repository for collaboration internally and externally.

- Request access
- Create a repository

- Create branch protection rules
- Invite your developer to the repository
- Review a pull request

Team Developer goals:

- Accept invitation to collaborate
- Make a contribution
- Create a pull request
