# MIND THE GAP WORKSHOP

Welcome to Mind the Gap workshop! In this workshop we will be helping you learn more about the open source development process. 

There will be three main personas that we will be learning more about in this exercise: Team Lead, team developer and external developer. Each role has unique responsiblities and things they need to do to help maintain the health of an open source project. As a team, you will walk through each of these three personas together but one person will be "driving".

## Open Source Development Personas

Within every team, you will identify team members to have specific roles:
- Team Lead
    - This person will be in charge of "owning" the repository and learning how to manage it from an administrative perspective
- Team developer
    - This person will be in charge of contributing to the project as a developer who is a part of the UN
- External developer
    - This person will be in charge of contributing to the project as an outside collaborator


### Team Lead

As the team lead, you will be responsible for maintaining our open source repository. We will go through a series of steps to help prepare our repository for collaboration internally and externally.

Team Lead Goals:

- Request access
- Create a repository
- Enable GitHub Pages
- Create branch protection rules
- Invite your developer to the repository
- Review a pull request

Team Developer goals:

- Accept invitation to collaborate
- Make a contribution
- Create a pull request
- Review an external developer's pull request

External Developer goals:
